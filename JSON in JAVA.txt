-> Use Json data in java (Android Studio)

1. Go to http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/.
2. In the "JSON" section, paste the JSON response from the API:
3. In the "Source type" section, select "JSON".
4. In the "Annotation style" section, select "Gson".
5. In the "Package" section, enter the package name you want to use for the generated Java classes. For example, com.example.myapplication.
6. In the "Class name" section, enter the name you want to use for the generated Java class. For example, JokeResponse.
7. Click the "Preview" button to preview the generated Java code.
8. If everything looks good, click the "Download ZIP" button to download the generated Java code as a ZIP file.
9. Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
10. Copy the JokeResponse.java file to your Android project's Java source directory (for example, app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication).
11. You should now be able to import and use the JokeResponse class in your Java code.
12. With the JokeResponse class in your Android project, you can now use the code I provided earlier to deserialize the API response into a JokeResponse object and extract the joke text.
